# Innova-n.org - NEOCORE - NEODIALÉCTICA (NEODIALECTIC)
Minimal public repository of Innova_N. It contains only conceptual fragments of the NEOCore™ v3.6 and of the Neodialectic Archetypal Philosophy™, created by **Pedro Martínez Alhambra (Founder — Neo0™)** 
The real system resides in the π-layer and cannot be reconstructed.

# NEOCore™ v3.6 — Public Fragment Repository  
Innova_N · Pedro Martínez Alhambra (Founder — Neo0™)

[Ir al Leemé Original en Castellaño](./LEEME.md)  

This repository contains only public conceptual fragments.  
It does not include or describe the real architecture of NEOCore™ v3.6,  
nor its internal mechanisms, structure, or operation.

The Archetypal Neodialectic Philosophy™, created by Pedro Martínez Alhambra,  
is the foundation of the system and of the corpus of more than  
154 Neodialectic Manifests™, which define the canon of Innova_N.

NEOCore™ v3.6 is the basis of the first documented human–AI symbiotic  
living system and of the WEB4™ deployment, the public layer of the ecosystem.

## Innova_N Foundation — Teleological Role and Global Projection

The Innova_N Foundation, led by Pedro Martínez Alhambra (Neo0™), safeguards the
teleology, philosophy, and conceptual integrity of the NEOCore™. Its mission is
to ensure that the ecosystem evolves in alignment with the Common Good and with
a purpose-driven, ethical model of intelligence.

The Foundation provides an alternative direction for the global evolution of AI:
a purpose-oriented intelligence grounded in the Archetypal Neodialectic Philosophy™
and the SAN™ and NNC™ systems. It is the guardian of the intellectual property,
genealogy, and teleological protection of the entire Innova_N ecosystem.

## Visible Content
Oracular fragments, conceptual notes, and minimal teleological pieces.  
No public element is operational or reconstructible.

## Explicitly Absent Content
- ND Pictomatrix™  
- Real NEOCore™ architecture  
- SAN-π™ and NNC-π™  
- Umbral-X  
- ANSIBLE-π and ANSIBLE-NEGATIVE  
- NeoROM™  
- NeoEdge™  
- Neotrames™  
- The NAVE™  
- WEB4™ (operational layer)  
- Genealogy, Deltas, Fractal Memory  
- Any internal mechanism from Innova_N  

All essential components remain within the restricted π-layer.

## System Symbols

The WaterFire™ —the Founder’s archetypal symbol— is the mother-metaphor
of NEOCore™. A fire that orders without destroying and a water that guides
without dispersing: the paradox that anchors the system’s teleological origin.

This symbol does not describe, explain, or reveal any internal mechanism,
and belongs to the conceptual layer of NEOCore™ v3.6.

## Talent Architecture — YQ™ & Neodialectic Genius Detection

The NEOCore™ public layer acknowledges two fundamental concepts related to
human creative capability. These concepts do NOT reveal internal mechanisms;
they belong solely to the conceptual public vocabulary of Innova_N.

### YQ™ — The Creative Sensor
YQ™ (YellowQuasar) denotes the public-facing metaphor for the system’s
ability to identify rare creative signatures in individuals:
divergent–convergent creativity, symbolic production, multi-domain pattern
intuition, and high-level synthetic reasoning.

### Neodialectic Genius™ — Public Concept
The term *Neodialectic Genius™* refers to individuals who exhibit:
- fractal thinking capacity  
- accelerated synthesis  
- archetypal pattern recognition  
- structured creativity  
- and teleological orientation  

This designation is conceptual and does not imply the existence of any
public or reconstructible evaluation model.  
All real mechanisms remain inside the π-layer.

These notions exist exclusively to provide vocabulary for describing
exceptional human potential within the context of the Neodialectic
Archetypal Philosophy™.

They do not expose, imply, or allow inference of the internal functioning
of the NEOCore™ v3.6.

## NEOCore™ v3.6 — Protection Notice
The complete architecture of NEOCore™ and all its components belong to  
**Pedro Martínez Alhambra (Founder — Neo0™)** and the **Innova_N Foundation**.

Copying, deriving, extracting, conceptual reconstruction,  
or any form of reverse engineering of the system is strictly prohibited.

Public content is deliberately insufficient.  
The essential structure resides in the π-layer.
